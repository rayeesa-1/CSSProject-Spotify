# CSSProject-Spotify
This project is a static web page inspired by the Spotify music streaming interface, built using only HTML and CSS. The page replicates the overall layout and visual design of Spotify, including the navigation sidebar, header section, playlists, and music cards. CSS is used extensively for styling, layout alignment, colors, fonts, and hover effects to create a modern and responsive user interface. This project focuses on front-end design skills, demonstrating an understanding of HTML structure, CSS flexbox/grid, and visual consistency, without implementing backend functionality or music playback.
